## Git Workflow Requirements ⚠️ CRITICAL - Main Evaluation Focus

### Branch Strategy (REQUIRED)

- `main` - Protected branch for production-ready code only
- `develop` - Integration branch for all features and Pull Requests
- Feature branches - Individual branches for each feature implementation
- Bug fix branches - For addressing any critical issues (if needed)

### Minimum Git Activities Required:

- ✅ At least **6 feature branches** (one per major feature)
- ✅ At least **18 atomic commits** total across all members (minimum 3 per member)
- ✅ At least **6 pull requests** with descriptive purposes
- ✅ At least **2 PRs must have review comments** from team members
- ✅ At least **1 merge conflict** resolved and documented in README
- ✅ All commits should convey meaningful change descriptions

### Pull Request Workflow:

1. Create a feature branch from the `develop` branch
2. Implement your feature with atomic commits following best practices
3. Push your feature branch to GitHub
4. Create a Pull Request with a description following the PR template
5. Request reviews from your mentors, co-mentors, or team leader
6. Address feedback and discussions from reviewers
7. Merge the PR after approval
8. Delete the feature branch after successful merge

### Pull Request Template:

When creating a PR, use the following template in the description:

```markdown
## Description
